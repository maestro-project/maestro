# MAESTRO: An Open-source Infrastructure for Modeling Dataflows within Deep Learning Accelerators
This is the latest development version of MAESTRO, so it may include new features not fully verified. The stable version can be found [here](https://github.com/georgia-tech-synergy-lab/maestro-stable).

# What is MAESTRO?
MAESTRO is an open-source tool for modeling and evaluating the performance and energy-efficiency of different dataflows. MAESTRO is actively developed by the [Synergy Lab](https://synergy.ece.gatech.edu/) at Georgia Institute of Technology. For more details about MAESTRO, please visit the following links.
